          <h4>Story Time with AngularJS</h4>
          <p>This is just my way of remembering important details about 
            writing user stories. It's also a fun way to play with
            <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, which is apparently
            all the rage and absolutely must be tried, etc. If it's useful, 
            fork away. <a href="#/story/new">Add a new story</a> and then 
            <a href="#/story/list">view all stories</a> to get started.</p>
